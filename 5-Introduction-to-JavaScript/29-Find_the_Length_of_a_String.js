// I learned how to find the character length of a string and that value can be assigned to a variable

// Example
var firstNameLength = 0;
var firstName = "Ada";

firstNameLength = firstName.length;

// Setup
var lastNameLength = 0;
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.

lastNameLength = lastName;
lastNameLength = lastNameLength.length
