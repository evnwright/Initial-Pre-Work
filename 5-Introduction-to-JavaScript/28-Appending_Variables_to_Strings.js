// I learned how to append variables so that they're strings will be connected like literal strings

// Example
var anAdjective = "awesome!";
var ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;

// Only change code below this line

var someAdjective = "pretty darn coolio.";
var myStr = "Learning to code is ";
myStr += someAdjective;
